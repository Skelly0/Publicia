Eastern Zdrolan | Mračera
Alternative names: Mrachera (Crinia), Rachera (Imperial)
Mračera, named by the Empire Rachera, is the most populated region of Zdrolan, on the eastern side of the Zdrolan Sea. 
Mračera Divisions
Mračera has traditionally been split between numerous coastal city-states. The main three of which are:
* Veljotan, found on the northeastern bay. In years past, Veljotan was marked by its aggressive raiding of southern polities. Once a feared naval power, the city often sent fleets southwards to seize riches, capture slaves, and demand tribute. Though this culture of raiding has subsided over the past few hundred years as the region has become more interconnected. Veljotan now acts as an important stop between the northern ice sheet and their northern vassals. Furthermore, Veljotan trades with the Tawaghet region to their east. The Veljotan area is home to many iron mines.
* Krstovlje, acts as a canal city between the populous Zangora Lake and the Zdrolan Sea. Its canal system is quite renowned and has been developed over centuries to facilitate trade and transportation. Much of the city has been built upon the marsh of the area, and so appears to float on the sea. Krstovlje has become the region’s hub for commerce, and its control over the canal means it dictates much of the traffic that flows between the inland territories and the sea. Historically, this has made the city both immensely wealthy and a prime target for military ambitions. Krstovlje is home to three different universities and so scholars from all over the region converge here.
   *      * Mirkovina, at the end of the large peninsula. Mirkovina has controlled most of the peninsula for a significant time and much of the region's industry is located there, with Mirkovina exporting the produced goods and textiles. Its factories and workshops produce the finest wares in Mračera, and much of the local economy revolves around export. Merchants from across Zdrolan and beyond come here to trade, and its ports are constantly busy with ships loading textiles, metalworks, and other produced goods. Mirkovina also acts as the main stopping point between Western Zdrolan and Eastern Zdrolan.
Mračeran Economy
The region thrives on trade, mining, and industry, facilitating the transfer of goods between the two sides of the region and mining various metals that are commonly found in the region, notably iron and copper. Mirkovina's factories drive the region’s export economy, producing goods that are shipped across the Zdrolan Sea. The canals of Krstovlje facilitate the transport of inland goods to the sea, while Veljotan’s port ensures that the northern territories and their extensive mines are connected to distant markets. Despite their past rivalries, the city-states rely heavily on each other economically. The recent decades have seen a relative peace, allowing trade to flourish and Mračera to grow into an economic powerhouse.
Mračeran Religion
Eastern Zdrolan are primarily Dutsas worshippers, belonging to the Eternals branch. Though, many Merouldists are found in Veljotan. Due to long standing trade with Crinia, Mračerans converted almost entirely to worshipping Dutsas, with pagan religions falling out of favour. 


However, since the fall of Crinia, pagan religions from Western Zdrolan have been on the rise. Chief among these are the Zogomilists, who believe in a world within the body and a world outside the body, revering their bodies as temples and often practice fasting and dancing to show their worship of their god, the Shaper, who carved every human out of clay. These Zogomilists are found in great numbers in Krstovlje where many political scholars have converted in recent years to distance themselves from Crinian religion.
Mračeran Culture and Society
Holidays
Surban Day is a day when people get married. This holiday was brought over from Eastern Zdrolan a few hundred years ago and has stayed around.
Burial Rites
The dead are traditionally put onto a raft and then sent out on a river or into the sea.
Marriage Customs
Similar to Western Zdrolan.
Marriages are made between four or five people, usually made up of roughly equal men and women. Not all of the people in a marriage will be in romantic relationships with each other. Typically, three of the people will be workers, and the others take responsibility as caretakers of children and the household.
People can only get married on Surban Day and do so in large celebratory festivals out in the streets.
Art
The foremost Mračeran art movement currently, is heavily expressionist paintings which focus on capturing the busy day to day life of cities and towns. Vehicles and industry also are strong focuses. (It’s Futurism)
  

Body and face painting are a long standing tradition of the Mračeran. The style of this typically follows the art trends of the day, however, many in more rural areas keep to more traditional styles that focus on religious depiction.
Language
Sounds like Serbian.
Fashion and Dress
Mračeran fashion heavily focuses on face painting, where various symbols and designs are painted onto the body. Few Mračeran go outside without some form of body paint on themselves.
Clothes-wise, Mračeran often wear voluminous robes that 
Architecture
Traditional and rural Mračeran architecture tends to be made of mud-coated wooden buildings. The mud helps to retain heat.
More modern Mračeran architecture tends to follow their art trends and so looks quite Futurist. 


Western Zdrolan | Malshkurta
Alternative names: Marlshcurta (Crinia), Malscherta (Imperial)
Malshkurta, named by the Empire Malscherta, is on the western side of the Zdrolan Sea. The region is characterized by its vast marshlands, shallow coastlines, and rich clay-based soil. These natural features define much of the local culture and economy, with clay pottery and terracotta craftsmanship being central to Malshkurta’s identity. The region is well-known for their decorated pottery that is exported throughout the Zdrolan region and onwards to Crinia.


The coastlines are largely unfit for deep-water harbors due to their shallowness, limiting naval capabilities but encouraging a strong relationship with the land, rivers, and marshes. Inland, lakes and rivers form the backbone of settlements, allowing for rich agricultural practices and freshwater trade routes.
Malshkurta Divisions
Malshkurta is divided into two main regions — Kurtabardh, in the south, and Vardashë, in the north — each with distinct cultural and political systems. The division between these areas is primarily based on geography and historical development.
Kurtabardh 
Kurtabardh is the most populous area of Malshkurta, supported by its fertile lands and numerous lakes, which provide an ideal environment for agriculture and settlement. The region has no centralized government or capital city; instead, power is distributed among a network of towns, each with its own council of priests or elders. This decentralized nature encourages strong local governance, with decisions being made by communal assemblies rather than by a central authority.
Despite lacking a capital, Kurtabardh maintains trade ties with other regions, especially with Mirkovina and the southern mountainous areas (region 6). These trade relationships are vital to the region’s economy, allowing Kurtabardh to export its surplus goods, particularly agricultural products and clay pottery. The towns of Kurtabardh are interconnected by a vast network of rivers and lakes, serving as natural highways for trade and communication.
Much of the economy of Kurtabardh thrives on fishing, agriculture, and the cultivation of the aquatic flowering plant known as Fushdelma. This plant, which grows in the marshes and lakes, is a nutritional staple food source that can be grinded into flour for making bread-like food. The leaves and roots of Fushdelma are highly nutritious and form a core part of the local diet. Kurtabardh has developed an extensive trade in freshwater fish and Fushdelma products, with both being exported in large quantities to neighbouring regions. Kurtabard is quite industrialised and many factories use the rivers of the region to power their watermills.
The region is also renowned for its clay and terracotta pottery, with many towns specialising in different styles of craftsmanship. Each settlement takes pride in its unique designs, making their wares highly sought after. Clay and terracotta is often imported from Vardashë due to its believed-higher quality. Furthermore, copper is found in abundance across the area.
Vardashë
Vardashë is much more rugged and sparsely populated than the south. The land here is dominated by vast marshes that stretch for miles, making large-scale settlement difficult. Instead, mostly small villages and trading outposts exist, many of them relying on the clay-rich soils for subsistence.
Vardashë is far less industrialised than the south. Villages are small and often built on stilts to avoid seasonal flooding. The marshes are difficult to navigate, and much of the transportation happens via shallow boats. The northern villages focus heavily on terracotta production and resource gathering from the marshes. While less fertile than the south, the northern region has vast clay deposits, fueling a significant terracotta trade. Large kilns are common in this part of the region, where artisans craft durable building materials, tiles, and sculptures. Trade with the southern towns of Kurtabardh is frequent, with goods often moving down toward the larger markets.
Malshkurta Religion
Across Malshkurta, the most prominent religion are the Zogomilists, who believe in a world within the body and a world outside the body, revering their bodies as temples and often practice fasting and dancing to show their worship of their god, the Shaper, who carved every human out of clay.


However, there are still many Dutsas worshippers, mainly Kerdaghites who have fled from persecution, and groups of Merouldists who have lived in the area since the peak of Crinia.


In recent years, a new cult has arisen in Vardashë to great success. Although they haven’t gained a foothold outside of the rural Vardashë, they are incredibly fervent in their worship of Qithion, an 8 limbed god who is said to have bestowed fire, industry, and civilization upon humanity, but warns against ever going beyond the breadth of Tundra. They preach an ethos where might makes right and where survival of the fittest is the path that humanity must follow.

Typically, two of the people will be workers, and the other two, caretakers of children and the household.
To confirm a marriage, a terracotta disc will be broken into four pieces, a piece will then be carried by each member of the marriage. This terracotta is often decorated or painted and is worn around the neck.
People can only get married on Surban Day and do so in special temples. After all the marriages are confirmed for a temple, a feast is held that welcomes any who wish to partake. The larger temples cook enough food to feed thousands.
Art
In Kurtabardh, the craft of pottery is more than just a trade; it is their central form of expression and art. Families pass down their techniques from generation to generation, and each town has its own signature styles. Ceremonial pots and figures are often made for religious rituals or community events.
Language
Sounds like Albanian.
