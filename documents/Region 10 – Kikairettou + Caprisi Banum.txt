Summary
Surrounded on all sides by the unconquerable frigidity of the Caprisi Banum ice sheet, and with no natural connecting ice valleys to the rest of tundra, Kikairettou is one of the most isolated places on Tundra. But there is no land on Tundra that is unburdened by the frigid winds that wrap the planet, and the hotspot archipelago is no different. Rather than a monoculture, the associated cities and settlements of Kikairettou find themselves a melting pot of different communities, from Nomad exiles, equatorial emigres, and merchant enclaves that deal in the always prized tech trade. Its government is nominally ruled by a central council of members of the ruling (and only) clan, but it has found itself split between an old decentralizing elite, and a new cadre of young commanders and intellectuals who wish to revive the despotic kingdom of old. 
        On the ice sheet, nomadic tribes of deer-herders search for refuge and scavenge ruins older than any known empire. Elsewhere, the haunting melodies of crawling machines echo through the glacier as a warning not to interfere on their pilots’ infinite pilgrimage. Both sedentary and nomadic societies find themselves often intersecting, whether for cooperation or conflict.


Mythohistory 
        The hotspot archipelago’s most recent formulation as a polity emerged during its interactions with the Toukanjin empire[1]. What their oral histories attest is that during the rapid rise of the Toukanjin, many migrants came to work in the archipelago due to its proximity to the polar cities and thus, the war machines that fueled the Toukanjin’s rise. The previously fragmented kingdoms and small communities that collated into a hotspot found themselves absorbed into an imperial orbit. According to legend, during this period Kikairettou became a cancer of smoke and steel, as the Toukanjin endeavored to create their own arms production facilities within their closest link to the industrial centers.
        Under imperial orbit, the archipelago was organized into a singular polity called the United Kingdom of Kikairettou, and many workers migrated to the region to find work in the factories Toukanjin enterprises had planted. While the fall of the Toukanjin empire remains frozen under centuries of ice, Kikairettou remains as the last extant appendage of the empire. For hundreds of years, the kingdom has written in its script and preserved writings from that empire, but the Kikairettou that existed under the Toukanjin is different from its present configuration. 
        The imperial project and all of its functions had successfully uprooted the clan society of proto-Kikairettou; corporate workshops supplanted their economic basis and the empowered security state deprived them of the ability to provide rectitude. It is said that the only clan which survived was the Huelonezu clan through their eager collaboration with the Toukanjin, and for this half of their name was rewritten in Toukanjin. But regardless of their virtue, the Huelonezu would be able to cling to power.
        With the collapse of the Toukanjin, so too did the authorities of imperial control. The archipelago’s fate fell back into the hands of the clans, but there was only one clan remaining. Oral history has taken to calling the king who steered Kikairettou after this collapse the First Virtuous King, for these accomplishments. Taking command of the government, he wrested power into his own hands and seized control of much formerly imperial property through the strength of his “knights”: a personal guard led by 15 of his 60 cousins and siblings wearing the mechanized armours that the Toukanjin had arrived in. 15 of his siblings were given lots of lands, while the remaining 30 made up the council and were given the greatest power, though ultimately forced to pay fealty to the king. The Huelonezu, redeemed by the Virtuous King, would go on to rule justly for the rest of his life, and his descendants would steer the course of Kikairettou to this very day.
        The ice sheet’s history is much older, and much more unknown. The Nomads have wandered it for as long as any myths can remember, presenting opportunity and threat to their sedentary neighbors, but for the most part they stick to themselves and wander the frozen plains. 
The Remembered Past
It has been hundreds of years since the Virtuous King ruled, and the 60 relatives he entrenched with responsibility have now grown to have power in their own right. The Kingdom is not even really quite a kingdom anymore, it exists now as a council of empowered businessmen, governmental officials, and some cliques of military men. Much of its supposed industrial might has given way to farms and villages, machinery now lies buried under centuries of soil. Not all industry has given way though, for the Royal Armory still produce Full Armors and Half Armors for the Royal Guard, and smaller workshops provide many goods and tools to the people of Kikairettou, resulting in the people of Kikairettou enjoying a surprisingly high amount of commodities considering their diminutive size. However, owing to their isolation, trade is still largely isolated from other areas.[2] 
        With these facts in mind some might call Kikairettou a harmonious region, but this is not quite true. The devolved power has led to some young officers and intellectuals to demand a return to the centralised kingly structure of mythology, to rid themselves of the weakness and stasis of the current era and bring Kikairettou into a state where it can finally be triumphant and expansive, so they believe is Kikairettou’s natural destiny. But these groups are rarely completely united, and the pure inertia of Kikairettou’s current status quo most likely means the centuries-old settlement will stay for at least another century or two. 
Geography
Kikairettou’s formation owes itself to a peculiar feature of Tundra’s geology, as hotspots under the surface bubble up through the terrain to create patches of warmer terrain that are capable of supporting a hardy kind of plant life. Subvolcanic activity creates ice cauldrons around the land, which become landing bays for docked Roamers, though some are cordoned off and filled with craters of their own for machine training exercises.
        In the languages of Kikairettou these hotspots are simply referred to as “lands”, with the largest and home to the majority of the population being land Jakan. Its warmth is provided by an active volcano and subterranean geothermal heating infrastructure that has existed before anyone was around to remember where it came from. Some people believe that the First Virtuous created it but this is almost certainly wrong, as it seems to be much older. These heating systems enable planting of the hardy ribi tuber, whose fields dot large portions of lands. Each land conforms to the shape of a large but often hill, with Jikan being the largest. 
        The ice sheets tend to be large fields of whiteness as far as the eye can see, but the wanderers report in the polar desert there are also ruins of old, very old civilisations who have spectacular scraps of technology. But owing to the sheer inhospitality and difficulty of  mapping the terrain, no ruin ever seems to stay around for long. 


Culture
Kikairettou is a land of speed and slowness, according to its inhabitants. As one of if not the most isolated inhabited areas on the planet, he must be incredibly self sufficient, often resulting in periods where the people must work incredibly hard to adapt to some disaster or natural event. At the same time, owing to the spans of the summer season and its very stable state. Some outside observers question whether the ability to relax and the ability to adapt quickly are traits that are really all that unique to the Rettounians, but it is still something they hold as a point of pride.
        Another trait of their society is that due to many of their inhabitants coming from disparate parts of the world with vastly different beliefs and cultures, the country’s mores take on very secular forms, with rituals being placed mainly through adherence to state sanctioned rituals alongside private practice. Some practices are also not without controversy, of course. Many are surprised by the fact that the only meat eaten that the majority of the population has the ability to consume is cured human flesh (it would be wasteful to not extract resources that are still there, especially when technology makes the reclamation so easy), or the perhaps unwarranted allegiance demanded by the country’s military, despite the fact that Kikairettou rarely faces that many military opponents.
Like their Arctic counterparts, the Antarctic Nomads employ breeds of tundra-deer, but while the northern Wanderers handle herds so large that the deers lead their caretakers, Antarctic deer tend to be hardy and more manageable in population. While they do still have the capability to raid, and can be quite terrifying raiders due to their mastery of longrifles, the generally smaller units of society result in societies that scarcely go “at war” and don’t eschew towards the clan structures of Siadset. In addition to maintaining their deer herds, a large part of their socioeconomic revolves around the discovery of ruins and the trading of that technology buried within. Somehow over the course of the generations which have lasted on the glacial desert, the ruins have not shifted; only moved. There is a recent attitude that the Rettounian society has become something worthy of disgust, owing to their desecration of their own bodies and placement of mortal states above divine imperatives.
Very little is known about the pilgrims due to their enigmatic nature, although when they talk they do not hesitate to let their religiosity pour forth. They claim to be acting within the ordinances of a divine machine/wheel/clock/heart (they can never decide on the right metaphor to use) and follow its orders absolutely, whether that be to create geometrically divine patterns in the frost, months long fasts, or raids on Rettounian lands. They spend most of their lives under the protection of their machines, tetrapodal armor comparable to the armours of those of the Rettounian knights but much larger, around the size of a cabin per unit, and outfitted for all spheres of life instead of war. They must know some process of how to fabricate them, but like many things about the pilgrims, they remain permanently locked within their minds. 
Vague Ideas
kikairettou is now split between different factions of the same clan steadily becoming their own sort of micro-clans in and of themselves and power has devolved a lot, but some believe this has weakened the kingdom and wish to return to a mythologised nationalistic version of the past. players can decide which of these visions they want to sponsor, do they want to centralise and absolutise the power of the kingdom like it was with the first virtuous king (and then subvert that to be under imperial influence, or keep the kingdom devolved so that it’s easier to subvert. 
        they also have an imperial past, their present state is inexorably linked to a past empire which vastly changed their society, but they have also moved on a lot since then, that empire fell. also they have cool mechs.


factions:
* new virtue, made up of young officers, intellectuals, and the now-weakened king who wish to establish a more authoritarian and centralised power in the kingdom
   * some also believe they can go on to conquer more shit
   * split between the intellectuals who believe in it more for political reasons and the military careerists who support it for the purpose of expanding and reforming the military
* clan elites, made up of the landholders, business owners, and liberal intellectuals who prefer the kind of devolved power the kingdom currently has cos it reduces government tyranny
* the majority of the population: kind of don’t care 


details:
* mechs are split between full armors who wear a big complex metal suit that covers the whole body and is very protective vs lightly armored suits who only cover the chest and the head which are cheaper and faster
   * full armors are basically knights and are treated with a lot of prominence
   * military diet is entirely plant based but they consume a lot of beans and stuff for protein
* diet is almost entirely plant based, there are some animals but it’s mostly for rich people, and killing animals is still treated as something kind of distasteful and wasteful
* secular just by virtue of so many different religions coming here that a secular authority was established, but generally a set of cultural morals has been established over the past thousand years to kind of make sure that everyone can still get along ethically anyway (vegetarianism is one of these things)
   * vegetarianism
   * kindness to guests
   * anti-cannibalism
   * almsgiving


* controversial practices:
   * some elders are stoned once they reach a certain point and used as fertiliser
   * rejection of religious authority

[2] Theories abound as to why Kikairettou has preserved some of its industrial capacity while industrialization seems to never be able to stick in the equatorial regions; but most philosophers argue it is due to the smaller populations of the polar regions, particularly Kikairettou, necessitating a greater amount of mechanised labour, while the populous equatorial regions like Crinia and Tawaghet have no such need.
