<universe_background>
This universe (or rather multiverse) is largely similar to our own with some chief differences. First of all, it is a completely fictional one. Earth as we know does not exist, and the season itself largely operates around a single political entity - the Infinite Empire. The Empire is a multiversal entity, spanning multiple planes of existence, each different from each other in very small ways. Millions of worlds, trillions of individuals, thousands of years of history, hundreds of wars. It's not a centralized entity, as nothing of such a scale can be, but rather a confederation of noble houses, corporations, divergent churches, charterworlds, and freeplanes who pay service to the One Emperor back in Core.

The universe itself is split along "planes", which could also be related as the multiverse being split into its own universes. In any case there are thousands of them, often visualized as layers of a cake stacked on top of each other, each only just slightly different than the one above or below, but very much different than its equivalent on a plane 200 layers away. Travel between planets and planes both is done by the same tool - Resonant Drilling. Some planets connect to their equivalents on different planes, and many connect to other planets on the same one. RD is a closely guarded enterprise, available only for the rich or imperial.

The universe outside of the Empire is irrelevant, empty, cold. There are no aliens, the most you'll see are variants of humans that may prove useful to the empire, or animals and plants we would call alien and unusual but which are perfectly edible by the average person. Humanity existed on its own on many different of these planets, not just one Earth-equivalent. All that we know of have been conquered by the Empire and are now ruled over by it. There is no escape from the Empire. You do not know anything about space, such as stars.

<ledus_banum_info>
Ledus Banum 77, which is the planet that interests us, is located in the Frontier plane of Eberras, it being first considered full imperial territory only barely 500 years ago. It's a very new conquest and during the early days of the Empire it would warrant little attention. The difference now are plentiful amounts of the resource Ordinium on the planet (common across all Ledus Banums, refined into both fuel and material for RD instruments) the lack of new conquests coming to the Empire, as the last discovered world before LB-77 was itself conquered 115 years after the one before it. Growth of the Empire has stalled for some time now, but it is little to be worried about. The Empire has recently invaded Ledus Banum 77, around 4 years ago, and a group of institutions are now integrating the planet and it's populace into the Empire.

<imperial_institutions>
The Imperial Institutions which have arrived on Tundra are: House Alpeh, The Universal Temple of the Church of the Golden-Starred River, The Imperial Manezzo Corporation (IMC), The Grand Chamber of Technology (GCT), The Kindred of the Rhodium Throne, and House Chaurus.

While we have presented the Empire as an almost monolithic entity to this point, a cohesive moving object of purpose and Imperial unity; beneath the gleam of Imperial sanction, obligations, and rituals lies the individual machinations, functions, and ambitions of the dozens upon thousands of institutions that in reality make up the Empire. Make no mistake — loyalty to the Imperial throne is an occasional obligation rather than a real ideal. One that belongs to, and is only truly believed by, dukes and scholars of the imperial core. Beyond the planar grasp of the court's grip, each institution, much like the needle on a compass, points away from the center towards a lodestone of their desire — be it a heterodox ideal, material wealth, or other forms of self-interest. Nevertheless it is these institutions that keep the wheel of the Eternal Empire turning in a competitive equilibrium, and if one spoke breaks the rest of the wheel goes with it.
