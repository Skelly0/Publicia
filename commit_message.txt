fix: resolve complex analytical query search failures

Problem: Complex queries like "Write a detailed analysis of Mong philosophy..." returned no relevant content, causing bot to respond "There is no mention of Mong philosophy in the records."

Root causes identified:
1. BM25 matching analytical words ("detailed", "analysis", "intersection") with irrelevant military/political content
2. Reranking being overly restrictive for complex queries, filtering out good results

Solutions implemented:
- Add _extract_core_topics() method to filter analytical words from BM25 queries, focusing on core topics ("mong philosophy theology")
- Adjust hybrid search weights to 95% embedding / 5% BM25 for better balance
- Disable reranking for complex analytical queries (keep enabled for simple queries via config)

Results:
- Before: "There is no mention of Mong philosophy..." (complete failure)
- After: Comprehensive 2-part response covering MÃ¶ng philosophy, theology, and their intersection

Files changed:
- managers/documents.py: Core topic extraction + weight adjustment
- .env: Disable reranking (RERANKING_ENABLED=false)
- debug_scripts/: Comprehensive diagnostic tools for validation
