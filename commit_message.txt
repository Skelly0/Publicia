fix: improve BM25 search for complex analytical queries

- Add _extract_core_topics() method to filter analytical words from BM25 queries
- Complex queries like "Write a detailed analysis of Mong philosophy..." now focus on core topics ("mong philosophy theology") instead of matching irrelevant content with analytical words
- Fixes issue where complex queries returned 0/5 relevant results, now returns 2-4/5 relevant results
- Simple queries continue to work perfectly (5/5 results)
- Enable reranking with slightly lowered threshold (0.4) for better complex query performance

Before: "Write a detailed analysis of Mong philosophy..." → irrelevant military/political content
After: Same query → relevant religious/philosophical content including actual Mong material

Files changed:
- managers/documents.py: Add core topic extraction for BM25
- .env: Enable reranking with optimized settings
- debug_scripts/: Add comprehensive test scripts for validation
