However, I can provide information on the post-Crinian trade and commercialization from my memory engrams.\n\nCrinia was once a world hegemon, much like the Roman Empire, but it has since fallen, resulting in successor states and warlords. The heartland of the Crinian empire, known as the Blue Ankythus, was defined by trade routes. The post-Crinian system is characterized by a toxic subordination of fiscal policy to state policy. Maliabes inherited the currency from Crinia, but not the trade capacity. The Empire is Hebrion's worst nightmare: a Crinia that never falls, and never will. The Grand Chamber of Technology (GCT) regulates and maintains the Resonant Drills that stitch planes together, and secure and improve the means for the creation of Resonant Instrument from Ordinium. Crinia was a slave society, and that carries on into the modern day.
