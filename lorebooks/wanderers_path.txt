"To Ertsa, I give you water from your domain, as you have given your tears to us for our sight. To Sasken, I give you my heart, as you have given your blood to us for our life."
* Traditional Wanderer initiation prayer, uttered prior to a ceremonial sacrifice of melted ice and either human or animal flesh.






  









The Wanderer’s Path
________________


Overview
In the equatorial ranges, the people worship Dutsas, a goddess of the sun and of warmth, and condemn the icy cold as the realm of demons. For those who travel those same snowy wastes, the cold is not something evil, but something just as holy as warmth. These nomads, who wander the snowy steppes, regard those settled peoples in the temperate areas as being drunk off excess, knowing no moderation in their sole worship of warmth. These sorts of people, then, are thought to be weak and lax in discipline, as they shun the cold night, even if it is one that strengthens them. And it is the Wanderers, then, who are the ones that embrace the truth of the world, and have the strength to embrace the bitter cold, knowing that the chilly winds breathe life into them.


A feature of the icy steppes, The Wanderers’ Path is not a uniform system of beliefs, but rather a general ‘family’ of interrelated religions held by the nomadic deer-herding peoples of the north. Due to the itinerant nature of most of its believers, the Path is one without a central hierarchy, and although religious leaders in individual bands of nomads may hold positions of esteem and leadership, there is no centralized hierarchy — a glaring difference to some of the Dutsas-Worshippers who live in the central areas of Ledus.


A religion that is at best exoticized by urbanites as the ways of a noble savage, and at worst the subject of persecution by many a Dutsasian zealot, the Path is neither a glorification of primitivism nor a blood-cult. Although some practices, such as the not-unheard of sacrifice of human flesh, are certainly looked down upon, they reflect centuries of life in the harsh steppe, and though they have a checkered history with the peoples of the equator, the nomads have learned to adapt to the cold, and are more than willing to adapt to other new situations headed their way.


Religious Story


TLDR: Two brothers, the deer god and the bear god, wandered the universe, until one day they stopped on one particular land. There, the two brothers had fought, until the deer had impaled the bear with his antlers, but instantly regretted it. From the river of blood from the bear’s body, and the river of tears from the deer’s eyes, did humanity emerge. There, they raised the bear to the heavens as the sun, and later the deer as the moon, where, to this day, the brothers chase each other to reunite.


Once upon a time, there lived two brothers. Ertsa, the elder, took the form of a majestic stag, whose antlers reached to the heavens above, and upon the tips of those horns were the stars. He had lived for thousands of years in the cold void, before he tired of being alone, and asked another god[1] to give him a companion.


His request was granted, yet it was placed with a condition. You will be forever bound to your companion, and wherever they go, so too you must follow. Desperate for someone who could accompany him, Ertsa eagerly accepted.


And so came Sasken, the younger, who took the form of a proud bear. Ertsa danced with joy as he named the bear his brother. It was then that the gods that created Sasken revealed Sasken’s curse. The bear would be cursed to eat life. Where once Ertsa may have at least found solace in his travels by resting in a welcoming place, no longer is that an option, for Sasken’s existence would have eventually destroyed what comforts were to be found there. And so too was Ertsa cursed, for the price of Sasken’s life was Ertsa’s own vitality, and every night, Sasken would give to his brother a drop of his blood to drink and replenish his life-force, otherwise the deer would become no more.


For the first thousand years, Ertsa traveled happily with his brother. For the second thousand years, he was comfortable. For the third he was ambivalent. For the fourth, he was discontent.


And on the fifth, he was incensed.


Upon stopping on one land, Ertsa shouted angrily at his brother: “It is because of you that I can no longer call any place my home, for you would have spoiled it before long. No longer may I find refuge in the domicile of the other gods and sire fawns."


Sasken was shocked by these words from a brother who he thought loved him dearly. So he asked his brother: “Did you not wish for me to come into this world? Does my existence truly cause you this much trouble?”


Frustrated at how ignorant his brother was of his pains, Ertsa answered with venom: “Had I known that your existence brings this much pain for me, I would never have sacrificed my freedom to bring about you, brother.” Ertsa laughed scornfully: “It is a matter of basic logic! I know not whether you are so selfish enough to think your life is worth more than the dozens of fawns I could have had, or if you are so stupid that you cannot count that many.”


Deeply hurt by these words, Sasken shouted back, letting his emotions out: “Then fool you are to bring me about, then! If that is truly how you feel, then not only you are a fool, but also a coward. If you truly think of me, who has never once wished harm onto you, to be all that you say of me right now, then I can only say that I’m sorry you do not see things as they truly are. I pity you! I pity that you are so stupid that you’ve deluded yourself to think of me this way! In your heart, you know what I say to be true, for otherwise you would have killed me by now!”


With his pride in question, and incensed with his younger brother’s words, Ertsa lowered his head and charged at his brother, piercing his flesh with his antlers.


Yet, even before he could withdraw his antlers from his brother’s body, a deep sense of dread came about Ertsa, as he realized his actions and immediately regretted what he had just done, fearing for the worst for his brother. As Ertsa unsheathed his horns from Sasken’s flesh, great rivers of blood flowed from his brother’s corpse, and warmth and life sprung onto the land below their feet.


Ertsa desperately nudged his brother’s corpse, trying in vain to rouse him from death, but as he did so, Ertsa could already feel his life waning from his body, and so, wishing to continue living in order to keep trying to wake his brother, Ertsa drank from the river of blood flowing out of his brother, his eyes pouring rivers of tears as he did so, crying for how, in a passing moment of anger, he had killed the brother he had loved so dearly.


From Ertsa’s tears, the sadness that he felt also streamed down unto the world below, and at where the rivers of Ertsa’s tears and Sasken’s blood met, did humanity emerge. From Sasken, they were given life, and from Ertsa, they were given knowledge. During this time, humanity could only comprehend sorrow, and so when they first beheld the brothers, the humans below cried out to Ertsa, “what distresses you so?”, for the deer’s sadness only added to their own.


Ertsa, too sad to consider being surprised at the appearance of these new humans, cried out himself: “I had killed my brother, and I will be alone once more!”


At this, the humans cried louder in their sorrow. Yet as they did so, the humans, being those who were created from Sasken’s blood, watched as Sasken’s spirit ascended to the heaven’s above, delivered from death through the intense emotion the humans had for the bear. Witnessing his brother ascend to the heavens, Ertsa was in awe, and hurriedly turned to the humans, begging them to send him to the heavens as well.


But the humans knew not how to do so, for they knew only sorrow, and try as they might to cry for Ertsa, they were unable to lift him into the heavens. As they wept for Ertsa, they quickly realized their cries, however loud, were not enough. They could not comprehend the means to elevate him, to release him from his pain, for they only knew which that bound him to sadness. It was then that Ertsa had made a proposal to the humans.


“Let me deliver you from your pain, by giving you knowledge beyond sadness, so that you may lift me up to see my brother as well.”


It was then that the humans, desperate to escape their miseries, accepted, and when they learned of love and all that stems from it. And as their voices rose, filled with hope and longing, Ertsa’s spirit began to ascend as well to reunite with his beloved brother once more.


In the end, Sasken lives as the sun, who continues to radiate life unto the world. He is followed by Ertsa, who lives as the moon. Having drunk the life of his brother, Ertsa also shines light down upon the world, even if the cold night comes as a reminder of the sorrow he and humanity once felt. The brothers chase each other to this day, seeking to finally reunite, and it is in honoring them and returning their sacrifices will they perhaps find each other once again.


Misc. Beliefs & Practices


* The deer god Ertsa and the bear God Sasken were a pair of legendary gods who wandered the universe — the story of how they created humanity and our world is only the last of many stories around the two as they encountered many of the universe’s other astral beings.
* After Ertsa killed Sasken in an argument, the river of blood that streamed from the bear’s corpse created life, while the tears from the deer’s eyes created knowledge. At the intersection of the two rivers, humanity emerged.
* As they were beings of divine essence, humanity was able to raise Ertsa into the heavens, and Ertsa now exists as the sun, his life-force shining down on the world. After making a deal with humanity, giving them the ability to love, Ertsa ascended as the moon. Having drunk the blood of his brother, so too does the moon shine.
* The brothers chase each other, trying to one day reunite. It is through worshiping and honoring the brothers that humanity is able to return the favor of the brothers’ sacrifice, assisting them to one day find each other. It’s because of this that they’re really focused on ‘returning’ sacrifice, including that of flesh.
* When you die and are buried into the earth, you become a ghost and watch over your clan, guiding the hand of those who come after you.
* Nomad children aren’t considered as belonging to the religion until they have been ‘initiated’, which happens when they turn fifteen[a]. When they do, they are brought up to a shaman, who tells them of the story about how the world and humanity came to be. This would be the ‘first time’ the child would learn of the story of Ertsa and Sasken[2]. After making a sacrifice of melted ice and flesh to both gods, the initiate will be asked which of the two gods they would like to learn more about. After making a decision, the initiate is then placed in a lodge with those who are already Erstakites or Saskenites, where they will stay the night in merriment, hearing other legends of the respective god. Once morning passes, they are to depart on the final stretch of their initiation. An Erstakite must seek out a wild deer (as in, one that is not herded by their community) and return its meat to the clan, while a Saskenite must seek out the den of a bear and leave at its entrance an offering of meat. When they return, they are finally recognized as a full member of the Wanderer’s Path.
* Flesh sacrifice is a prominent theme in the Path, as it mirrors the way in which the sacrifice of Sasken’s flesh had brought about life on Ledus Banum. In returning blood and flesh to the brothers, they are made slightly more whole, assisting them in their mission to reunite. While the most infamous instances of flesh sacrifice were that of live human captives in years past, the most common example nowadays would be either a live deer, or a very thin slab of human flesh.
* Back in the really old days when the world was just one giant free-for-all deathmatch and when the nomads were all fighting each other for the best herding grounds, they engaged in quite a lot of live human sacrifice with their war captives to try and earn the gods’ favor. Although these days they mostly don’t do that anymore with their increased contact with the agricultural settled peoples, that does not stop some Dutsas Worshippers from using it as a point to vilify the Wanderers as savage cannibal demons spawned from the darkness.
* When human flesh is used in ritual, sometimes it is the flesh of a criminal who is released upon surrendering some of their flesh, but many look down at this revision from the old ways as offering ‘unworthy’ flesh. The blood of warriors and soldiers who proved their valor in battle are the most deserving to be sent to the gods. Most would rather sacrifice a live deer than use a prisoner’s flesh.
* Although the existence of Ertsakites and Saskenites may imply a degree of separate worship, it’s really more than a personal choice of which god you prefer within the singular Path as opposed to anything else. You are not bound to which brother you initially chose, and there’s practically no restrictions or advantages conferred in choosing one over the other. It is literally unthinkable that you can be an Ertsakite in this world if there are no Saskenites, and vice versa. Intermarriage happens all the time, you do not hold separate religious functions, you are still worshiping the same exact religion.
* “Blood-brothers” and “blood-sisters” exist in their culture, but it isn’t declared willy-nilly. If a Wanderer declares you to be their blood-sibling, that is a bond that is about as strong — if not even stronger — than marriage. It’s basically saying that you’ll be best friends for eternity, even in the afterlife[3], and as such, it is a very serious thing to have blood-siblings.
* Fratricide is an extremely forbidden taboo, because although it was through Ertsa’s killing of his brother that the world as we know it was created, it had condemned the brothers to chase each other, spending millenia without each other’s embrace. It is with this in mind that you would find that many ‘kings’ or rulers of the nomads often rule alongside their siblings rather than wielding power alone, avoiding the uncomfortable succession conflicts that occur with other peoples. Patricide still occurs, though. In fact, it’s slightly above average, considering that your evil step-brother wants to team up with you in order to kill your dad so that the both of you can inherit the throne, instead of going with his original plan of killing you to become the heir.
* Killing a bear is another taboo — unless your life is in danger, you just do not kill a bear. You can, as the nomads often do, herd and slaughter deer, but if you do so, you do not let anything go to waste to honor the deer’s sacrifice. If you are one of those southern motherfuckers who just hunt deer for the horns[4], get the fuck out of town.
* It literally does not matter what level of technology they’re in, any Ertsakite who is in a war-related profession is going to have an antler helmet. If it’s medieval, then you got a pair of antlers on that knight dome armor. If it’s WW1, it’s a Brodie helmet with antlers stapled on top. Even if it’s modern-day, they’re gonna have a medieval-style helmet on display on their shelves to be pulled out and used for formal ceremonies (but they’re still mad as hell that they aren’t bringing it to battle).
* The fact that the southern states often hires poor Wanderers as mercenaries (taking roles as scouts, snipers, and in more-unfortunate circumstances, shock-troopers thrown at enemy lines) leads to a tragedian sort of circumstances where Wanderers fight each other under the banner of countries that don’t particularly care for them.
* They regard the people of the equator as being very excessive in their enjoyment of Sasken’s gifts, who neglect to properly honor Sasken, and who forget the sacrifices made by Ertsa. As such, the Wanderers see themselves as being more civilized and disciplined than the settled peoples, as they find honor in the struggle to live in the cold.
* Despite their tense relationship with most Dutsasians, they’re actually pretty chill with the Kerdaghites, if only for the fact that they both can’t fucking stand the church and government, and have similarly-long histories of religious oppression by the other branches of Dutsas-Worshippers. The Kerdaghites sharing the same practice of worshiping both the sun and the moon as equals is an added bonus to their already-good relationship[5].


________________
[1] There are dozens of alternate stories as to the story of Ertsa’s ‘birth’, and so there is no ‘standard’ version of which god, or set of gods, did Ertsa make his appeal to. The most popular is that Ertsa made his appeal to a murder of crows, who collectively are the malevolent goddess Vroga. Other stories have Sasken’s creator be a benevolent one, who lamented that Sasken’s existence was destined to be cursed.
[2] In practice, however, it is near-guaranteed that the child has heard it at least a dozen times by the time that they reach fifteen years, as there is nothing that prevents the tale being told by parents or friends before initiation. In many cases, it’s the shaman themself who ‘spoils’ the story years before the actual ceremony. The initiate will, however, still be expected to act as if this would be their first time hearing.
[3] To illustrate, if the Wanderers had a version of heaven and hell (they do not), then you would willingly give up the chance to enter heaven if it means that you get to be together with your blood-sibling in hell.
[4] Recently, some equatorial states encourage their populace to go out in the tundra to hunt wild deer en masse for sport. The main reason is to try to deny the nomads their primary food source, to mixed effect (since the nomads usually herd their own deer rather than hunt wild ones).
[5] The Kerdaghites are often accused of being ‘Wanderers shrouded in the cloth of Dutsas’ due to this belief by other branches of Dutsas-Worship. However, as the Kerdaghite sect developed in isolation from the Wanderers, it is very unlikely that this was in any way inspired by the Wanderers. That doesn’t stop the accusations, though.
